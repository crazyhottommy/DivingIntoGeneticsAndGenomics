      <description>I was reading Feature Selection and Dimension Reduction for Single Cell RNA-Seq based on a Multinomial Model. In the paper, the authors model the scRNAseq counts using a multinomial distribution.
I was using negative binomial distribution for modeling in my last post, so I asked the question on twitter:
for modeling RNAseq counts, what&#39;s the difference/advantages using negative binomial and multinomial distribution? — Ming Tang (@tangming2005) November 26, 2019   some quotes from the answers I get from Matthew</description>

      <description>This post is inspired by two posts written by Valentine Svensson:
http://www.nxn.se/valent/2017/11/16/droplet-scrna-seq-is-not-zero-inflated
http://www.nxn.se/valent/2018/1/30/count-depth-variation-makes-Poisson-scrna-seq-data-negative-binomial
The original ipython notebook can be found at https://github.com/vals/Blog/blob/master/171116-zero-inflation/Negative%20control%20analysis.ipynb
Thanks for writing those and put both the data and code in public. After I read Droplet scRNA-seq is not zero-inflated by Valentine Svensson, I want to gain some understanding of it. This post is an effort to replicate some of the analysis in the preprint using R. The original analysis was carried out in python.</description>

      <description>“Every model is wrong, but some are useful”— George Box
In an effort to better understand the distribution of single-cell RNAseq counts, I dived a bit deeper into the negative binomial distribution in the context of R. I am by no means an expert in statistics and writing this post is for myself to better understand it.
what is a negative binomial distribution I will quote from wiki:
 Suppose there is a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials.</description>

      <description>There was a paper on this topic: A New Online Computational Biology Curriculum.
I am going to provide a biased list below (I have read most of the books if not all). I say it is biased because you will see many books of R are from Hadely Wickham. I now use tidyverse most of the time.

      <description>Background Please read the following before go ahead:
 what is docker?
 what is Rocker?
 what is singularity?
  from Harvard Research computing website: Odyssey has singularity installed.
 Why Singularity? There are some important differences between Docker and Singularity:
  Docker and Singularity have their own container formats. Docker containers may be imported to run via Singularity. Docker containers need root privileges for full functionality which is not suitable for a shared HPC environment.</description>

      <description>TSS enrichment score serves as an important quality control metric for ATACseq data. I want to write a script for single cell ATACseq data.
From the Encode page:
 Transcription Start Site (TSS) Enrichment Score - The TSS enrichment calculation is a signal to noise calculation. The reads around a reference set of TSSs are collected to form an aggregate distribution of reads centered on the TSSs and extending to 1000 bp in either direction (for a total of 2000bp).</description>

      <description>scATACseq data are very sparse. It is sparser than scRNAseq. To do clustering of scATACseq data, there are some preprocessing steps need to be done.
I want to reproduce what has been done after reading the method section of these two recent scATACseq paper:
A Single-Cell Atlas of In Vivo Mammalian Chromatin Accessibility Darren et.al Cell 2018   Latent Semantic Indexing Cluster Analysis  In order to get an initial sense of the relationship between individual cells, we first broke the genome into 5kb windows and then scored each cell for any insertions in these windows, generating a large, sparse, binary matrix of 5kb windows by cells for each tissue.</description>

      <description>I was writing an R script to plot the ATACseq fragment length distribution and wanted to turn the R script to a command line utility.
I then (re)discovered this awesome docopt.R. One just needs to write the help message the you want to display and docopt() will parse the options, arguments and return a named list which can be accessed inside the R script. check http://docopt.org/ for more information as well.</description>

      <description>I want to split the PBMC scATAC bam from 10x by cluster id. So, I can then make a bigwig for each cluster to visualize in IGV.
The first thing I did was googling to see if anyone has written such a tool (Do not reinvent the wheels!). People have done that because I saw figures from the scATAC papers. I just could not find it. Maybe I need to refine my googling skills.</description>

      <description>I need a transcript to gene mapping file for Salmon. I am aware of annotation bioconductor packages that can do this job. However, I was working on a species which does not have the annotation in a package format (I am going to use Drosphila as an example for this blog post). I had to go and got the gtf file and made such a file from scratch.
Please read the specifications of those two file formats.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 01/29/2019. Read this awesome paper Statistical tests, P values, confidence intervals, and power: a guide to misinterpretations.
This was an old post I wrote 3 years ago after I took HarvardX: PH525.3x Advanced Statistics for the Life Sciences on edx taught by Rafael Irizarry. It is still one of the best courses to get you started using R for genomics. I am very thankful to have those high quality classes available to me when I started to learn.</description>

      <description>PCA is a critical method for dimension reduction for high-dimensional data. High-dimensional data are data with features (p) a lot more than observations (n). However, this is changing with single-cell RNAseq data. Now, we can sequence millions (n) of single cells and each cell has ~20,000 genes/features (p).
I suggest you read my previous blog post on using svd to calculate PCs.
Single-cell expression data PCA In single-cell RNAseq analysis, feature selection will be performed first.</description>

      <description>PCA in practice. Principle Component Analysis(PCA) is a very important skill for dimention reduction to analyze high-dimentional data. High-dimentional data are data with features (p) a lot more than observations (n). This types of data are very commonly generated from high-throuput sequencing experiments. For example, an RNA-seq or microarry experiment measures expression of tens of thousands of genes for only 8 samples (4 controls and 4 treatments).
Let’s use a microarray data for demonstration.</description>

      <description>featureCounts is a program to fast summarize counts from sequencing data. I use it to get gene-level RNAseq counts by
featureCounts -p -t exon -g gene_id -a annotation.gtf -o mysample_featureCount.txt mapping_results_PE.bam
If you have a lot of samples, you will get a lot of *featureCount.txt and you will need to merge them for downstream analysis.
I will show you how to merge the tables using R, python and unix below.</description>

1. The devil 1 and 0 coordinate system read detail here https://github.com/crazyhottommy/DNA-seq-analysis#tips-and-lessons-learned-during-my-dna-seq-data-analysis-journey
some files such as bed file is 0 based. Two genomic regions:
chr1 0 1000 chr1 1001 2000  when you import that bed file into R using rtracklayer::import(), it will become
chr1 1 1000 chr1 1002 2000  The function convert it to 1 based internally (R is 1 based unlike python).</description>

Do not re-invent the wheels. Actually, reading other people’s code and mimicing their code is a great way of learning. Today, I am going to show you how to compute binned averages/sums along a genome or any genomic regions of interest.</description>

      <description>Data backup is an essential step in the data analysis life cycle. As shown in a pic below taken from DataOne.
There are so many important things you may want to back up: your raw/processed data, your code, and your dot configuration files. While for every project, I have git version control my scripts (not the data) and push it to github or gitlab to have a backup, big files can not be hosted on github or gitlab.</description>
