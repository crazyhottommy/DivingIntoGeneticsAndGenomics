Once I have a programming problem in mind, the first thing I do is to google to see if other people have encountered the same problem and maybe they already have a solution. Do not re-invent the wheels. Actually, reading other peopleâ€™s code and mimicing their code is a great way of learning. Today, I am going to show you how to compute binned averages/sums along a genome or any genomic regions of interest.</description>

      <description>I have used blogdown writing regular markdown posts, but the real power is from the Rmarkdown! let me try it for this post.
Note that you do not knit the Rmarkdown by yourself, rather you let blogdown do the heavy lift.

      <description>I have been following this tutorial from Alison and tips from Leslie Myint for some customization for deploying my blogdown website

There are so many important things you may want to back up: your raw/processed data, your code, and your dot configuration files. While for every project, I have git version control my scripts (not the data) and push it to github or gitlab to have a backup, big files can not be hosted on github or gitlab.</description>
