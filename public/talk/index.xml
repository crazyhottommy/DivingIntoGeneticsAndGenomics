      <description>I taught the ChIP-seq bioinformatics lab for the GS01 1143 Introduction to Bioinformatics course to ~30 people with diverse background. Some of them did not have any experience with terminals. I walked through the materials slowly and it was well received!
I developed the course materials here.
I plan to develope it to a Data Carpentry type of course materials, more work to come!
Enjoyed the teaching a lot!

      <description>I was excited to teach Shell and R to a group of 20 biologists from the University of Miami. This event was sponsored by Software carpentry https://software-carpentry.org/ and the University of Miami. see the course info here.
It was great teaching experience for me!
