# About me

I am a computational biologist working on genomics, epigenomics and transcriptomics. Being trained in a wet lab in the University of Florida during my PhD in [Dr.Jianrong Lu's lab](https://biochem.med.ufl.edu/research/primary-faculty/jianrong-lu/) has established my solid knowledge and skills in experimental molecular cancer biology. Self-teaching and postdoctoral training in [Dr.Roel Verhaak's lab](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/faculty/roel-verhaak) has extended my bioinformatics skills in integrating analysis of TB size sequencing data sets. Verhaak lab is well known for studying genomic alterations of brain tumor by analyzing large panels of RNA-seq and DNA-seq data. I gained extensive experience in handling large-scale genomic data and pipelining workflows. I also gained intimate familiarities with public data sets such as [TCGA](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and [CCLE](http://www.broadinstitute.org/ccle/home). I have put my analysis notes and snakemake pipelines for processing whole-exome, whole-genome DNAseq, RNAseq, single-cell RNAseq, ChIP-seq, ATACseq and RRBS data in my [github repos](https://github.com/crazyhottommy).

Now, with both experimental and computational biology skills on my belt, I am ready to tackle cancer biology problems with my expertise. My ultimate goal is to make new discoveries in cancer biology and translate the knowledge into effective new therapeutic strategies to benefit cancer patients in the end. I also have a great interest in promoting open science and reforming bioinformatics education. I frequently share my thoughts on [twitter](https://twitter.com/tangming2005) and tips in my [blog post](http://crazyhottommy.blogspot.com/). I am a certified instructor for [carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).
