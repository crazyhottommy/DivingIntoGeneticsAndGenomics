### Background
Please read the following before go ahead:

* what is [docker](https://www.docker.com/)?  
* what is [Rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org/)?  
* what is [singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/docs/)?  


from Harvard Research computing website: [Odyssey has singularity installed](https://www.rc.fas.harvard.edu/resources/documentation/software/singularity-on-odyssey/).

>Why Singularity?
There are some important differences between Docker and Singularity:

* Docker and Singularity have their own container formats.
* Docker containers may be imported to run via Singularity.
* Docker containers need root privileges for full functionality which is not suitable for a shared HPC environment.
* Singularity allows working with containers as a regular user. No sudo is required,

Our [informatics group](https://informatics.fas.harvard.edu/) has several big memory (1TB) computing nodes that allow us to run interactive jobs. I want to have big memory to run Rstudio for my scRNAseq data.

### Run Rstudio server with singularity
I basically followed this tutorial https://www.rocker-project.org/use/singularity/ written by my colleague Nathan Weeks sitting in the same office with me. Thanks!

First, go to https://www.rocker-project.org/images/ choose the image you want. I use `tidyverse` heavily, so I downloaded the `tidyverse` image buit upon `Rstudio` image


```bash
## ssh to remote HPC and pull the docker image by singularity
ssh bio1
mkdir singularity-images; cd !$
singularity pull --name rstudio.simg docker://rocker/tidyverse:latest


# This example bind mounts the /project directory on the host into the Singularity container.
# By default the only host file systems mounted within the container are $HOME, /tmp, /proc, /sys, and /dev.
# type in the password you want to set, make it more complicated than this dummy one
PASSWORD='xyz' singularity exec --bind=/project  rstudio.simg rserver --auth-none=0  --auth-pam-helper-path=pam-helper --www-address=127.0.0.1

```

back to my mac and connect to it via [SSH tunnel](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/tunneling/):

Nathan explained by drawing the following.

```bash
ssh -Nf -L 8787:localhost:8787 bio1
```


on my local mac, open `localhost:8787` in web browser, type in the Odyssey (HPC) user name and password (xyz in this dummy example). Rstudio server now is ready for me! Magic!!!

Note: if mulitple people using the same node for Rstudio sever, you will need to pick a different
port than `8787`.
### One more note on R packages

create an `.Renviron` file in your home diretory
```bash 
# User-installed R packages go into their home directory
echo 'R_LIBS_USER=~/R/%p-library/%v' >> ${HOME}/.Renviron
```
The platform and version will be replaced by the corresponding R versions

```bash
ls ~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/
3.6
```

install packages inside Rstudio and the packages will be installed to `~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.6`. R version in this singularity image is R3.6. Note that if you use R on command line at the remote machine and use the same version of R. the library may not be compatible. e.g. singularity container is based on debian ï¼ˆUbuntu) and HPC is based on RPM (CentOS). One may need to have mulitiple `.Renviron` file and switch back and forth depending on which R one is using. If you have better options, please let me know!

### Jump to other folders
by default, Rstudio opens the home directory. if you want to go to other folders, you can click `...` in the file pane.
You can then type in the path you want to jump to.

### Submit a slurm job

If you do not have a big computing node that you can run interactive job, you can follow Nathan's [tutorial](https://www.rocker-project.org/use/singularity/) on how to submit slurm job to run Rstudio server with singularity.
