It is the end of the year again and it is a good time to review my 2020. I wrote [one](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.rbind.io/post/the-end-of-2019/) for 2019. It has been a tough year for many of us. It is the same for me. I switched my job from [Harvard FAS informatics](https://informatics.fas.harvard.edu/pages/about.html) to [Department of Data Science at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://ds.dfci.harvard.edu/) during the shutdown because of COVID19 at the end of March and has been working from home since then. I am grateful for my stay in the Harvard FAS informatics group. Tim has been super supportive and the collaboration with Catherine Dulac's lab was exciting. I learned a lot about single-cell analysis.


It is a weird feeling that I have not been to the office since I joined [Shirley's group](https://liulab-dfci.github.io/), but I have to say it turned out to play well. I am thankful that Shirley thought of me to join her team to lead the bioinformatics effort of the [Cancer Immunologic Data Commons (CIDC)](https://cimac-network.org/cidc/) project. It is a complicated project and involves many parties. I decided to take the challenge and made the mind to improve myself. It is also my great honor to interact with the [software team](https://ds.dfci.harvard.edu/knowledge-systems/team/) led by Ethan Cerami and James Linsay for this project. I learned tremendously from them on the software side. To be honest, the job is not easy, but the good thing is that I have been learning a lot in many aspects. I learned a lot about cancer immunology, hiring, writing, managing, and communicating. 

Still, I want to list some highlights for 2020.

1. My first co-first author computational [paper](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.rbind.io/publication/2020-04-03-kmt2d-lung-cancer/) is finally published in *Cancer Cell*. It means a lot to me. I was studying cancer molecular biology in my Ph.D. and made the jump to computational biology for my postdoc with [Roel Verhaak](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-verhaak-lab) when he was in MD Anderson Cancer Center. Computational training in Roel's lab has paved a solid foundation for my work. I then published two other papers on [evaluating single-cell cluster stability](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.rbind.io/publication/2020-05-29-scclusteval/) and [fast analysis of single-cell ATAC-seq data](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.rbind.io/publication/2020-03-20-kallisto-scatac/).

2. I finished one statistics course and one big data course with Grade A from Harvard Extension School.

3. We did a five-week intensive bioinformatics training for the new hires in Shirley's group. We hired 5 people in 3 months! I am a big fan of reproducible research. I gave a [talk on reproducible computing](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.rbind.io/talk/2020-reproducible-computing/) during the training. 

4. I did a presentation on [our single-cell analysis pipeline MAESTRO in the Broad seminar](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.rbind.io/talk/2020-maestro-broad-talk/) and gave a talk in the [PACT meeting for the CIMAC-CIDC project](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.rbind.io/talk/2020-maestro-pact-talk/).

5. I had my foot wet on single-cell TCR-seq and BCR-seq analysis. The best way to learn how to analyze a type of NGS data is to analyze the data for a project. I learned a lot by googling and from our local experts Li Song in the same group. 

6. I started to invest myself in career development. I had someone coach my communication skills and took a leadership course.

In the coming 2021, I want to make our CIDC bioinformatics team more successful, to make all the team members more sucessful. Of course, I should be writing more papers. I can see two co-first author papers, one first-author paper, and one senior author paper coming out. I always want to enhance my statistics background and I plan to go through [Elements of Statistical Modeling for Experimental Biology](https://www.middleprofessor.com/files/applied-biostatistics_bookdown/_book/). Most importantly, I will continue to try to be a better human, a better husband, a better father, and then a better researcher. 

I wish everyone to have a safe and prosperous new year!
