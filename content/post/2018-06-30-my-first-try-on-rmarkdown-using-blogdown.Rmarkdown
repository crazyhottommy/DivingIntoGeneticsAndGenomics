I have used blogdown writing regular markdown posts, but the real power is from the Rmarkdown! let me try it for this post.

Note that you do not knit the Rmarkdown by yourself, rather you let blogdown do the heavy lift.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
head(mtcars)

```

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) + geom_point()

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x= as.factor(cyl), y = hp)) + geom_boxplot(aes(color = as.factor(cyl))) + geom_jitter()
```

It is awesome! blogdown will knit and render the code and the output into a html file. How cool is that!!
