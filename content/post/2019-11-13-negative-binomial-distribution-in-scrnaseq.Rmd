"Every model is wrong, but some are useful"--- George Box

In an effort to better understand the distribution of single-cell RNAseq counts,
I dived a bit deeper into the negative binomial distribution in the context of `R`. I am by no means an 
expert in statistics and writing this post is for myself to better understand it.


### what is a negative binomial distribution 

I will quote from [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution):

>Suppose there is a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. Thus, each trial has two potential outcomes called "success" and "failure". In each trial the probability of success is p and of failure is (1 − p). We are observing this sequence until a predefined number r of failures have occurred. Then the random number of successes we have seen, X, will have the negative binomial (or Pascal) distribution:

$$X\sim \mathrm {NB} (r,\,p)$$

The probability mass function of the negative binomial distribution is:

$${\displaystyle f(k;r,p)\equiv \Pr(X=k)={\binom {k+r-1}{k}}(1-p)^{r}p^{k}}$$

Sometimes the distribution is parameterized in terms of its mean $$\mu$$ and variance $$\sigma$$ :


$${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&p={\frac {\sigma ^{2}-\mu }{\sigma ^{2}}},\\[6pt]&r={\frac {\mu ^{2}}{\sigma ^{2}-\mu }},\\[3pt]&\Pr(X=k)={k+{\frac {\mu ^{2}}{\sigma ^{2}-\mu }}-1 \choose k}\left({\frac {\sigma ^{2}-\mu }{\sigma ^{2}}}\right)^{k}\left({\frac {\mu }{\sigma ^{2}}}\right)^{\mu ^{2}/(\sigma ^{2}-\mu )}.\end{aligned}}}$$

Let's see how it is implemented in `R`:

Open the help page `?rnbinom`

`rnbinom(n, size, prob, mu)`

$${\displaystyle f(x;n,p)\equiv \Pr(X=x)={\binom {n+x-1}{n-1}}(1-p)^{x}p^{n}}$$


**This represents the number of failures which occur in a sequence of Bernoulli trials before a target number of successes (n) is reached.** The mean is μ = n(1-p)/p and variance n(1-p)/p^2. 

Notice the difference from the definition from wiki above.


>size	
target for number of successful trials, or dispersion parameter (the shape parameter of the gamma mixing distribution). Must be strictly positive, need not be integer.

This is the n in the formula.

>prob	
probability of success in each trial. 0 < prob <= 1.

This is the p in the formula.

>mu	
alternative parametrization via mean: see ‘Details’.

Details:

>An alternative parametrization (often used in ecology) is by the mean mu (see above), and size, the dispersion parameter, where prob = size/(size+mu). The variance is mu + mu^2/size in this parametrization.


It is a bit confusing since we can define it in different ways. We can verify it by ourselves.

Suppose we do independent Bernoulli trails 10 times, with a success probability of 0.4, what's the probability we see 4 failures before the 6th success?

```{r}

## this is the total number of failures, the random variable X 
x<- 4

p<- 0.4

## size, the number of successful trials we are targeting
size <- 10 - x

dnbinom(x= x, size = size, prob = p)
```


one possible outcome is:

SSSSSFFFFS

The last trail has to be a success.

```{r}
## this is the same as 
choose(size + x -1, size-1) * p^(size) * (1-p)^x

## and 
choose(size + x -1, x) * p^(size) * (1-p)^x

```


we can simulate the negative binomial distribution counts by

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

rnbinom(10000, size = size, prob =p) %>%
        enframe(name = "seq", value = "num") %>%
        ggplot(aes(x = num)) +
        geom_histogram(col="white", bins = 30) +
        geom_vline(xintercept = x, linetype = 2, col= "red")

mean(rnbinom(10000, size = size, prob =p) == x)
```

We see it is close to the exact p value.


An alternative parametrization (often used in ecology) is by the mean mu (see above), and size, the dispersion parameter, where prob = size/(size+mu). The variance is mu + mu^2/size in this parametrization.

$$X\sim \mathrm {NB} (\mu,\,\sigma)$$

```{r}
mu<- size/p - size 
mu
variance<- mu + mu^2/size 
variance

dnbinom(x= x, size = size, mu = mu)
```

We see it is the same result.

with 

$${\displaystyle f(x;n,p)\equiv \Pr(X=x)={\binom {n+x-1}{n-1}}(1-p)^{x}p^{n}}$$
we can calculate the probablity when x = 0 
i.e. the probability that we see a 0 count in RNAseq data.

$${\displaystyle\Pr(X=0)=p^{n}}$$

and we know prob = size/(size+mu)

The size or $\phi$ is dispersion parameter in gamma distribution (the shape parameter of the gamma mixing distribution). let's replace the p using $\phi$:

$$\Pr(X=0) = \left(\frac{\phi} {\mu + \phi}\right)^{\phi}$$

The variance is:

$$Var = \mu + \frac {\mu^2}{\phi}$$
