abstract = "The molecular basis for the clinical heterogeneity observed in patients with malignant rhabdoid tumors is unknown. Recently, two reports revealed molecular intertumor heterogeneity in teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs) and extra-cranial MRTs (ecMRTs) using genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic profiling. Distinct molecular subgroups were identified and new therapeutic targets were revealed."
