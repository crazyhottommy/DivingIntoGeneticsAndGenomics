I was invited to give a talk on reproducible bioinformatics research to the students in the [Bunker Hill Community College](https://www.bhcc.edu/) in Boston, MA. I was so glad to introduce bioinformatics to the students and share my own perspectives on reproducible research.

The movie [Good Will Hunting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Will_Hunting) was shot there :)
