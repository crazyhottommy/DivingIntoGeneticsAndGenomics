In the lab meeting today, I introduced some of the linux tricks and apps I have been using 
for my daily work. I consider myself as a genomic data scientist. It is a bioinformatician's rebranding according to [Jason Williams](https://twitter.com/JasonWilliamsNY/status/1236671856788242436).

I am sharing the PDF here, hope you find some of the tricks are useful too!
