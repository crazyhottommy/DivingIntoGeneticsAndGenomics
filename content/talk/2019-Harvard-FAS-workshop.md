In this 2-week long Harvard FAS informatics nanocourse, I co-taught snakemake
for one afternoon and lead-instructed scRNAseq analysis for a full day.

* The snakemake workshop material was adapted from Titus Brown and can be found at
https://github.com/crazyhottommy/2019-snakemake-Harvard-Informatics-nanocourse

* The scRNAseq workshop material was developed using [workflowr](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr) and can be found at
https://crazyhottommy.github.io/scRNA-seq-workshop-Fall-2019/

* The rest of the nanocourse material can be found at https://github.com/harvardinformatics/micro-course


I used the [carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) teaching style. A blue sticky note means OK and a red sticky note means having problems.
