I taught the ChIP-seq lesson for 2018 ANGUS Next-Gen Sequence Analysis Workshop held in UC Davis from 7/1/2018 to 7/14/2018, and TAed for the rest of the sessions. You can find my class link [here](https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2018/chip-seq.html) and all the rest materials [here](https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2018/). This is the first formal teaching I have done after I became a certified instructor for Data Carpentry. The same teaching skills applied! 

Some tips for teaching:

* Be slow in pace
* Pause and have students ask questions
* Draw on white borad. (I am a visual person)
* Use sticky notes to get an idea of how the class room feel. red sticker means problem. green sticker means OK!
