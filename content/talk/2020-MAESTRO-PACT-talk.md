In the joint [Partnership for Access to Clinical Trials (PACT)] (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/clinical-trials/pact) and [CIMAC-CIDC](https://cimac-network.org/) Network Fall meeting. I presented the update for our bulk ATAC-seq pipeline and the MAESTRO single-cell workflow. I led the discussion of the adoption of single-cell ATAC-seq in the CIMAC trails afterwards.
