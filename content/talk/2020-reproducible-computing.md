We are hiring several new computational biologists in Shirley Liu Lab. All the new hires together with wet lab people 
are going through a 5-week long intensive bioinformatics training: [STAT115](https://liulab-dfci.github.io/teaching).

I am TAing for 2 weeks and I gave a talk on reproducible computing. Please find the PDF here and share!
